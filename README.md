## Notes for setting up the project
If you are setting this up for the first time, you need to add a few environment variables and the keys that you will actually be using when you access them:
 - `sheep_tag_list_id`
 - `newsletter_list_id`
 - `mailchimp_api_key`
 - `discord_client_id`

 After these keys are added to the environment variables, everything should work.
